Feature: Output metadata

  As a user
  I want to get some meta data about the script
  In order to use it better

#  Scenario: Version (short)
#    Given I successfully run `filegen -v`
#    Then the output should contain:
#    """
#    Version:
#    """
#
#  Scenario: Version (long)
#    Given I successfully run `filegen --version`
#    Then the output should contain:
#    """
#    Version:
#    """
#
